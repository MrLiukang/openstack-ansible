    A behavior for AIO setup regarding network configuration has been changed.
    Instead of directly applying all configuration during ``boostrap-aio.sh``
    script, script will produce another variable file
    ``user_variables_systemd.yml`` with intended configuration.
    Variable will be consumed and applied by ``openstack_hosts`` role, which
    will be launched during setup-hosts (setup-everyting) playbook.
