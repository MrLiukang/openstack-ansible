    Etcd role has been removed from ``ansible-role-requirements.yml`` as it's
    no longer required by any component.
    If you are relying on the role or etcd in your deployment, you can add the
    following to your ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user-role-requirements.yml``:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      - name: etcd
        scm: git
        src: https://github.com/noonedeadpunk/ansible-etcd
        version: master
