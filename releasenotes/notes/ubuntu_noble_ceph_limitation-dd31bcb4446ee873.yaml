    On Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) Ceph packages are available only from native
    repository or Ubuntu Cloud Archive. Thus, version selection for Ceph is not
    available at the moment and Ceph Squid (19.2.X) is being the only available
    option.
    This is a subject to change whenever a community repository will start
    building packages for Ubuntu 24.04.
