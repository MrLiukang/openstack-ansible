Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack-Ansible provides Ansible playbooks and roles for deploying
and configuring an OpenStack environment.

Documentation for all previous releases is available by substituting ``latest``
with an expected release (i.e. ``|previous_series_name|``) directly in the address bar (URL)
of your browser.

Support status for each OpenStack release can be found on `releases.openstack.org <https://releases.openstack.org/>`_.
